Explanation:
- The provided JSON structure outlines the specific metrics you identified earlier, ensuring the GPT output is organized and easily parsed by your application.
- Remember to adapt the competitor_mentions field based on your specific industry and competitors. You might need to pre-populate it with potential competitors for the model to recognize and count.
- You'll need to decide how to quantify "longest monologue duration" â€“ either in seconds or as a percentage of the total call duration.
- Sentiment analysis can be more nuanced; you might want to consider a scale (e.g., 1-5) or categories like "very positive," "slightly negative," etc., instead of just positive, negative, and neutral.`
